            <li>Add the flour and, using your fingertips, rub the butter mixture and flour to achieve a crumbly texture.</li>
            <li>Add the water and press the mixture together to form a ball.</li>
            <li>Knead the pastry on a lighly floured work surface until it is blended (maximum 30 seconds).</li>

            <li>Add the cream and whisk it in, then place in the fridge.</li>
            <li>On a lightly floured surface, evenly roll the pastry into a 3mm thick circle. Roll the pastry over the rolling pin and unroll it over a 24cm loose-bottomed tart tin. Carefully tuck the pastry into the bottom edge of the tin so that it fits tightly.</li>
