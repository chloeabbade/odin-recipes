        <h3 class="header">Description</h3>
        <p>Before its rise as the poster child of Caribbean food, Jerk had a long history in Jamaica.
            It is thought to have been brought over from South America, who cooked meats in sacred fire pits called 'barbicu'. 
            This method of cooking was suited to the needs of the Maroons, escaped slaves who had settled and established colonies in the island's mountains. </p>
        
        <p>Following the abolition of slavery, the Jerk method of cooking migrated to the streets and beachs of Jamaica, and a legacy was born. </p>
